  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Aurélien Peden, a Research Engineer at the INRIA Saclay CEDAR Lab and École Polytechnique (LIX Lab). I’m passionate about AI, with a focus on areas like NLP, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and large language models. I’ve been into computer science since I was 10, starting out with Python and C before diving deep into AI. Over the years, I’ve worked on all kinds of cool projects, like making AI more explainable for cancer diagnostics, worked on the development of a deep learning framework to train neural networks on Apple silicon chip, developing object detection and segmentation systems, building semantic search tools with vector databases, and exploring various applications of large language models.

I am currently working on information retrieval and vector databases to simplify the fact-checking process for journalists.
